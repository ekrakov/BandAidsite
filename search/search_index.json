For example, we might wish to see if some arrangement of atoms forms a semiconductor or a metal, or to go further and compute the thermal and electrical conductivity of the material.

However, a material contains many atoms, resulting in a periodic potential. Electrons now display complex interatomic behavior, with linear combinations of bonding and antibonding states. This drastically changes the energy landscape: single-atom electron orbitals have neatly-spaced discrete energies, but electrons in a many-atom system have orbitals that hybridize and combine, yielding a continuous spectrum of allowed energies around the single-atom energies. These solutions are numerous enough to form a continuous band in reciprocal space, and the result is what is known as a band structure.  </p> <p>Out interest is in solving the energy states of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation under a periodic potential such that \\(V(\\br)=V(\\br+\\bR)\\).
