# Multiple square wells (Animation) 

## Multi–Square-Well 

In this animation, we explore how discrete quantum energy levels evolve into energy bands when multiple square wells are arranged in one dimension—mimicking, in a simplified way, how an electron behaves in a crystalline solid. Note that we are only solving the single-electron Schrödinger equation.

### 1. Single Square Well 

- Begin with one square well by setting the number of wells to 1. The square potential represents a simplified model of an electron bound to a single atomic nucleus.  
- In the second figure, you can see a set of discrete bound-state energy levels. If we were to solve the full 3D Schrödinger equation, these levels would correspond to the energies of particular orbital configurations.  
- The third figure plots the wavefunction corresponding to a selected energy level. Change the index in the second figure to explore how the wavefunction evolves with different eigenstates.

### 2. Adding Two Wells

- Next, increase the number of wells to 2. The atomic nuclei is sitting at the center of the well. A single electron can interact with each nucleus. 

- In the third plot, you can see the wavefunction and its probability amplitude. For the first eigenstate (index 0), the electron is primarily localized between the two wells—analogous to a bonding orbital in chemistry.  
- Now set the eigenvalue index to 1. You’ll observe that the probability of finding the electron between the wells is negligible, which corresponds to an antibonding orbital. The first two orbitals can be roughly viewed as s-type bonding and antibonding states.  
- If you move on to the second and third eigenstates (indices 2 and 3), you’ll notice bonding and antibonding states that resemble p-like orbitals in shape.

### 3. Formation of Bands

- Continue by changing the number of wells to 14.  
- As more wells are added, the individual energy levels split and begin to form a nearly continuous band of allowed energies, separated by band gaps—energies the electron cannot occupy.  
- This captures, in a simplified manner, how overlapping atomic orbitals in a real crystal produce valence and conduction bands, with forbidden energy regions (band gaps) between them.

### 4. Additional Parameters: Well Depth, Spacing, and Width

- The animation allows you to tune various parameters: the depth of each square well, their barrier width, and the distance between wells.  
- The **barrier width** (distance between wells) controls wavefunction overlap. A larger barrier typically reduces overlap and widens the band gap.  
- The **well depth** determines how tightly bound each state is, shifting the entire set of energy levels up or down.  

Experiment with these parameters to see how they affect the shape of the wavefunctions, the spacing between energy levels, and the formation of continuous bands versus isolated levels.
